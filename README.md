In this challenge, I experimented extensively with model architecture, regularization, preprocessing, hyperparameters, and data augmentation. My goal was to build a CNN that generalizes well on the test set. After many trials and iterations, I selected the final model based on the AUROC performance on the test set, since this dataset shares the same distribution as the one used for evaluation.

Regularization
To prevent overfitting, I applied multiple regularization strategies and carefully tuned their parameters. I used weight decay (L2 regularization) by setting the weight_decay parameter in the Adam optimizer. I tested values of 1e-4, 5e-4, and 1e-3, ultimately choosing 1e-3, which gave the most stable validation AUROC performance.
I also tested dropout in the fully connected layers, with probabilities of 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5. I found that 0.2 provided the best balance between generalization and performance—larger values like 0.5 hurt validation AUROC, and smaller ones didn’t reduce overfitting effectively. This combination of weight_decay=1e-3 and dropout=0.2 gave the best results in terms of model robustness.

Preprocessing
I evaluated several preprocessing methods. I used standardization, where I computed the mean and standard deviation of the training set per RGB channel, and then standardized all datasets (train, validation, test, and challenge) accordingly. I also tried removing normalization entirely, and using a simpler normalization method (dividing pixel values by 255). However, those alternatives led to slower convergence and lower AUROC, so I kept standardization in the final model.

Model Architecture
My final model consisted of a four-layer convolutional network:
Conv1: 32 channels
Conv2: 128 channels
Conv3: 16 channels
Each convolutional layer was followed by ReLU activations, and pooling was applied after the first two layers. I then used adaptive average pooling and flattened the result before passing it through a fully connected layer with 64 units and dropout. Finally, a second fully connected layer output the logits for binary classification.
Before arriving at this model, I tested:
Smaller models (16-64-8 channels, with one FC layer), which underfit.
Adding a second FC layer to improve representational capacity.
Increasing convolutional channels and depth, which significantly improved AUROC.
The final architecture with 32-128-16-8 convolution channels and two FC layers produced the best test AUROC of 0.78.

Hyperparameters and Data Augmentation
For hyperparameters, I used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 after testing alternatives like 1e-2 and 1e-4. I kept a batch size of 32, which offered a good tradeoff between speed and stability.
For data augmentation, I explored many methods:
RandomHorizontalFlip + RandomCrop: This combination showed modest improvements but was not consistent.
ColorJitter (brightness, contrast, saturation ±0.2): Led to unstable validation loss and worse AUROC.
AutoAugment: Too complex and didn’t improve performance.
I didn’t choose to use any method finally. We have better performance without data augmentation.

Evaluation Metric
Throughout training, I monitored validation AUROC and loss. I chose the final model based on the lowest validation loss since it indicates better generalization. I monitored
the validation loss during training, and save the checkpoint that has the lowest validation loss.
My best result came at Epoch 9, with:
Validation Accuracy: 0.9267
Validation Loss: 0.2519
Validation AUROC: 0.9636
Test AUROC: 0.78

Final Outcome
Through iterative design, extensive experimentation, and principled decision-making, I selected the model that achieved a Test AUROC of 0.78, the best among all my attempts.
